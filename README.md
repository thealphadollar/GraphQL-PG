# GraphQL-PG

A repository to learn about both - server and client side implementation of graphQL.

## Tech-Stack

I'll be following the [GraphQL tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0lDGjwRYKw&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iK6Qhn-QLcXCXPQUov1U7f&index=1) by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg).

The following tech-stack is used in the entire program:

- Backend
  - NodeJS with express
  - MongoDB (remote DB based in mLab)
- Frontend
  - ReactJS with Apollo

I will be building a service that would show details about books using graph queries from the frontend.
